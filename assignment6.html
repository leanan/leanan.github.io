            For this assignment, I used a potentiometer to communicate its data values to a webpage over serial.
            The potentiometer provided by arduino is a variable resistor which reaches as high as 10k Ohms.
            To do this, I set up my potentiometer to be connected to GND, 5V of power, and
            to the analog pin A0. The schematic and set-up are shown below.
            <br>
            As the dial of the potentiometer is turned from low (lowest is 0) to high (up to 1023),
            the serial communicates to the webpage its data value. Using Javascript, I was
            able to coordinate this line with the values read from serial to spike when values were high
            and drop when they were low.
