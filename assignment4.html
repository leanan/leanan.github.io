            <h1>Assignment 4: High(er) Voltage and Transistors!</h1>
            <h2>Using a transistor to control load power separate from logic power</h2>
            <h3> The assignment: Uses analogWrite(), a high-load output device,
            a transistor, and an input sensor

              <h4> In this circuit, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a transistor are being used to alter
              the brightness of an LED strip. </h4>

              <h4> The LDR </h4>
              The LDR is connected by one leg to 5V of power, and the other leg
              to an analog INPUT pin, A0, as well as a 10k Ohm resistor and back to GND.

              <h4> Transistor and LED strip </h4>
              From the microcontroller, Pin 9 connects to a leg of a 1k Ohm resistor,
              where the other leg is connected to the Base of the transistor by a wire. The emittor
              leg of the transistor connects back to ground. The collector leg of
              the transistor connects to the negative leg of the LED strip through
              an alligator clip. The positive leg of the LED strip is connected to power by a wire
              to the positive screw terminal of a 12V power cord, the negative screw terminal connects
              to the breadboard to circulate back to ground.

              <p>
              To ensure that the base of the transistor gets enough current, the
                minimum resistor value should be at least 180 Ohms. For the sake of this assignment,
                I used 1k Ohms to be safe with the higher voltage. Similar to the previous assignment,
                I connected the LDR to a 10k Ohm resistor because it can handle the range
                of daylight values registered by the LDR.
