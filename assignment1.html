              The assignment: A circuit that limits the
              current flowing through at least 3 LEDs using resistors.

            For my circuit, I decided to use Red, White, and Blue LEDs. In order
            of flashing, I used Pin 11 to power the Blue LED, Pin 12 for the White LED,
            Pin 13 for the Red LED, and connected GND to the negative side of the
            breadboard. I calculated the resistance for each LED with respect to
            their drop voltage (Red = 1.8V, Blue & White = 3.3V) and found that
            each calculation was within 1k Ohms, so I used 1k Ohm resistors for
            each LED.
