              <h4> The LED & LDR</h4>
              In this circuit, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) is being used
              to alter the brightness of an LED.

              The LED is connected to power through Pin 11 and is set as an OUTPUT,
              with the other leg connecting to a 1k Ohm resistor and to GND.
              The Blue LED has a voltage drop of 3.3V.
              By calculating the resistance required, I found that R = (5V-3.3V)/ 0.02 = 85 Ohms
              It is because the required amount of resistance for this LED is satisfied by the
              1k resistor, that I used it in this circuit.

              The LDR is connected by one leg to 5V of power, and the other legal
              to an analog INPUT pin, A0, as well as a 10k Ohm resistor and back to GND.

              By using the code provided below, the sensor can turn the LED off
              in the presence of bright light (a certain value in the code) or turn the
              LED on and vary the amount of brightness.
