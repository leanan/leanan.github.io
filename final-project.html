              An idea I had was to create a temperature detector for users who
              leave their pets or children in enclosed spaces that are subject to overheating,
              like a car, covered strollers, or poorly insulated rooms in a house.
              What immediately comes to mind is using Arduino's Thermistor and possibly
              LEDs to generate some type of feedback as to whether the enclosed space
              is too hot to keep an animal or small child in.

              <br>
              <b>Update 2/11:</b> Based off the past few assignments, I could possibly use
              an LED to serve as a form of feedback to a certain temperature threshold being met
              or some sort of speaker to allow for audio feedback.

              <br>
              <b>Update 2/15:</b> In addition to the LED or audio feedback, this product
              could also serve the purpose of being left in a room/area to be able to detect temperature levels that
              border on too hot or too cold. It could send an alert or message to notify the owner
              that a certain temperature threshold has been met and to return immediately.
              (ex: "It's too hot in here!" or "It's too cold in here!")
