              An idea I had was to create a temperature detector for users who
              leave their pets or children in enclosed spaces that are subject to overheating,
              like a car, covered strollers, or poorly insulated rooms in a house.
              What immediately comes to mind is using Arduino's Thermistor and possibly
              LEDs to generate some type of feedback as to whether the enclosed space
              is too hot to keep an animal or small child in.

              <h3><b>Update 2/11/19:</b></h3>
              <p> Based off the past few assignments, I could possibly use
              an LED to serve as a form of feedback to a certain temperature threshold being met
              or some sort of speaker to allow for audio feedback.
              </p>
              <br>

              <br>
              <h3><b>Update 2/15/19:</b></h3>
              <p> In addition to the LED or audio feedback, this product
              could also serve the purpose of being left in a room/area to be able to detect temperature levels that
              border on too hot or too cold. It could send an alert or message to notify the owner
              that a certain temperature threshold has been met and to return immediately.
              (ex: "It's too hot in here!" or "It's too cold in here!")
              </p>
              <br>

              <br>
              <h3><b>Update 2/28/19:</b> </h3>
              <p> Knowing that I will need to use a Thermistor for this project,
              today I spent some time learning how to set up the circuit and write code in the Arduino
              sketch. Below I have images of the circuit where the 10k Thermistor (provided by my Arduino kit)
              is connected to a 100k Ohm resistor. One leg of the resistor is connected to GND, the other
              to a leg of the Thermistor. A wire is then connected to the analog pin A0 to the same
              row where the legs of the thermistor and resistor are connected. The other leg of the Thermistor
              is connected to 5V of power.
              <p>
              <p>
              So far, this code and set up works, but the code only reports the resistance value of the
              Thermistor. I will need to figure out a conversion from resistance value and its associated
              temperature, preferrably in Fahrenheit. Additionally, I'll need to figure out how
              I will display feedback once a certain temperature threshold is met. This could be as simple as
              as a Red LED lighting up when the temperature is too high and a Green LED when it is "Ok". A
              more ambitious approach could be using the LCD screen to display a message containing the reported
              temperature read by the Thermistor and whether or not the encclosed area is safe.
