              An idea I had was to create a temperature detector for users who
              leave their pets or children in enclosed spaces that are subject to overheating,
              like a car, covered strollers, or poorly insulated rooms in a house.
              What immediately comes to mind is using Arduino's Thermistor and possibly
              LEDs to generate some type of feedback as to whether the enclosed space
              is too hot to keep an animal or small child in.
