            <h1>Assignment 2: Fade!</h1>
            <h2>Using a button to make an LED fade!</h2>
            <h3> The assignment: Make an LED fade using a button, resistors, as
              well as using functions analogWrite(), digitalWrite(), digitalRead(),
              and for loops.

              <h4> The Button </h4>
              For my circuit, I connected one leg of the button to power (5V) and
              the other to a 1k Ohm resistor. When a pin is setup as an input
              - in my code, Pin 2 is named buttonPin and is set as an input -
              the voltage can float between 0V and 5V, so using a resistor helps establish
              a definitive voltage value for the pin, in this case, 5 volts. When pushed,
              the button will connect the pin to ground and it will to 0 volts.

              <h4> The LED </h4>
              I connected a Red LED, similar to Assignment 1's schematic, to Pin 6 and
              a 1k Ohm resistor and connected it back to ground. Within the code,
              once the button is pushed and held down, the Red LED will begin to fade.
